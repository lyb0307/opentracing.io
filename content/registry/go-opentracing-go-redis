description: I searched for the redis client of golang with opentracing, they are all out of date. 
             I noticed there was an instrumentation of go-redis (https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/goredis) supports the v6 version of go-redis. 
             While the latest version is v8 and they have changed their "WrapProcess" method to "Hook" interface.
             Also I noticed go-redis has their own tracing based on OpenTelemetry (https://redis.uptrace.dev/tracing/).
             So I just modified it to support opentracing.
             Here it is.
